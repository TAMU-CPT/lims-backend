- Wet lab meeting distractions
- sample tracking


## Notes

- Bathtub distribution of GO annotations
- No challenges
- GO - Crappy docs / hard to know exactly which buttons to click
- course resource link doc wasn't updated
- no one responded to genome questionnaire until <1 week to go
- need to ensure that cpt/bich464/

## Wet Lab People

- Students were great. Most were bright, entuhsiastic, but a few not so great.
- Biggest issue was when students were missing labs but put lots of strain to tqake huge chunks of schedule to allow them to make up[ labs. especialyl since they take so long to make up the labs.
- Not sure what the right answer is, but need to make it clear up front to students that it isn't acceptable to miss the lab. They need to bow out of lab or sth.
did parts they missed for them.
they'd come in for 2-3 hours and they were slow and it was destorying time.

### lab protocols

done before semester starts
without chandler, would've been screwed. Always have a technician, someone who doesn't mind making media etc

digest lab was supposed to be easy, turned into a clusterfuck.
Believed enzymes were there when they told us they were there. Trusted, failed to verify.

need an instructor calendar with required dates / stuff
need separate instructor / student protocols.

ESR: email for instructor notes.

Chandler kept spreadsheet of media, knows what to bring down, what's available.
After every lab took biohazard out, flushed water baths.

Make room in time to check phage stability, a quarter of phages aren't stable.
A pickate sitting in LB / lysate in LB lose titer and can't detect anything.
Admins check how stable, or students have to go back and re-extract. Arg
against is that students know going in that bio can fail.

Keep all portions of all samples. They need to keep all of their dilutions. They need to have a box.

EM portion -- need to have someone there who can do it WELL + FAST. One
instructor complained of having issues doing it quickly. Need to stay on
schedule.

EM issue -- account numbers are issues for the CPT / EM reservation.

- Lab by lab questionnaire. Everyone has a smartphone, questionnaire system
  worked fine. Devron lab takes notes + edit them online in a system. Sperber
  wants more wiki than.
- Camera from library, record lectures + wet lab. Have some video, can do voice
  overs, etc.
